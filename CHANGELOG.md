# Changelog

## 1.1.0 (June 23, 2013)

* Added a new configuration: `config.robot.mention_name`. This allows the display name of the robot `config.robot.name` to differ from the name Lita uses to detect a message as a command. For example, on HipChat, Lita's name might be displayed as "Lita Bot", but might be mentioned in messages with "LitaBot". This value will default to `config.robot.name` if not set.

## 1.0.0 (June 22, 2013)

First stable release.

## 0.0.1 (June 15, 2013)

Initial release.
